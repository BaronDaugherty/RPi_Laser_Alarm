RPi_Laser_Alarm
===============

A laser tripwire alarm built on raspberry pi.

This was a project I was inspired to try because we like to prank each other in my house.
I figured if I could give myself the technological advantage then I absolutely should!

What you'll need:
A raspberry pi with raspbian OS installed,
Internet connection (if you desire to use the email feature),
Raspberry pi camera module,
A photoresistor, some LEDs, a couple 220 ohm resistors, one capictor,
A laser (mine is a red 5w).

You might use:
A breadboad to prototype the circuit first,
A breakout board for the Pi if you're using a breadboard.

Images of the setup are in the imgs folder and the code comments should be easy enough to follow,
feel free to message me with questions or ideas.

Happy hacking!
